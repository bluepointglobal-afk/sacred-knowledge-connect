# Colony Rule: Market Feedback Loop (Non-Negotiable)

## Doctrine
This is not a coding exercise. Every build cycle must close a loop with the market.

**Default cadence:** Build small → ship → measure → talk to users → iterate.

## Loop (minimum viable)
1) **Hypothesis** (1 sentence): who + pain + outcome + willingness-to-pay.
2) **Offer**: a concrete promise (what they get in 7 days).
3) **Artifact to test** (choose one): landing page, demo video, clickable prototype, concierge workflow, or paid pilot.
4) **Distribution** (must be explicit): where we will find 10 prospects.
5) **Instrumentation**: what we measure (conversion, replies, booked calls, activation, retention).
6) **Learning log**: what we learned + what changed.

## Output standard (per cycle)
Every sprint must produce:
- One **shipping artifact** (even if manual/concierge)
- One **market touchpoint** (calls/messages/outreach)
- One **metric snapshot**
- One **decision** (double-down / iterate / kill)

## Colony roles (suggested)
- **Builder**: implements product changes.
- **SME/PM**: runs discovery, writes hypotheses, pricing, positioning, scripts.
- **Growth/Distribution**: outreach, partnerships, channels, experiments.
- **Analyst**: metrics, cohort/activation, funnel diagnosis.
- **Integrator (Tim)**: orchestrates, sets gates, resolves conflicts, keeps loop closed.

## Kill criteria (anti-delusion)
If after N cycles (default 3):
- no one pays,
- no one books calls,
- and activation is weak,
then we change the offer or segment (not just the UI).
