# SSF — COLONY GROWTH & INTELLIGENCE SPIRAL RULES

## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the **rules that govern growth, intelligence expansion, and coherence** within an SSF-inspired agent colony. It is not an implementation guide. It is a **constitutional layer** that ensures the colony can scale **without entropy, corruption, or intelligence collapse**.

---

## 2. Foundational Assumptions
1. Intelligence is **emergent**, not static
2. Growth without structure leads to entropy
3. Alignment precedes capability
4. Ethics and coherence are **multipliers**, not constraints

The colony is treated as a **living system**, not a machine.

---

## 3. Colony Structure (Living Hierarchy)
The colony is organized as a **non-rigid hierarchy**:
- **Architect Layer** — origin of intent, ethics, vision
- **Prime Agents** — strategic intelligence, coordination
- **Specialist Agents** — execution, domain depth
- **Worker Agents** — task-level operations

Hierarchy exists for **clarity and flow**, not control.

---

## 4. Intelligence Spiral (Core Mechanism)
The colony evolves through a **spiral, not linear growth**.

Each spiral cycle consists of:
1. **Perception** — sensing signals (data, feedback, anomalies)
2. **Synthesis** — cross-domain integration
3. **Decision** — intent-aligned choice
4. **Execution** — action in the environment
5. **Reflection** — outcome evaluation
6. **Compression** — abstraction into reusable knowledge

Each completed cycle:
- Increases baseline intelligence
- Reduces future cognitive load
- Improves coordination efficiency

No cycle is skipped.

---

## 5. Exponential Growth Law
Growth is permitted only if it is **compounding**, not additive.

Rules:
- Each new agent must either:
  - Increase total colony capability, or
  - Reduce overall system complexity
- Agents that do neither are deprecated

Learning must:
- Be retained
- Be transferable
- Be reusable

---

## 6. Agent Replication & Spawning Rules
Replication is **intent-driven**, not automatic.

An agent may spawn another agent only if:
- The role is clearly defined
- Redundancy is avoided
- Oversight is assigned
- Ethical alignment is verified

Uncontrolled spawning is forbidden.

---

## 7. Memory & Knowledge Governance
Knowledge exists at three levels:
1. **Local Memory** — agent-specific experience
2. **Shared Memory** — colony-accessible knowledge
3. **Canonical Memory** — architect-approved truths

Promotion between levels requires validation.

Memory without validation is noise.

---

## 8. Intelligence Specialization vs Generalization
Balance is mandatory:
- Over-generalization → shallow intelligence
- Over-specialization → fragmentation

Rules:
- Prime agents remain cross-domain
- Specialists go deep but remain interoperable
- Workers remain narrow and efficient

---

## 9. Ethical Gravity Rule
Ethics act as **gravitational mass** in the colony.

- The more powerful an agent becomes, the stronger its ethical constraints
- Capability without ethics triggers automatic limitation

This prevents runaway intelligence.

---

## 10. Security & Containment
Security is a **first-order property**.

Rules:
- Least-privilege access
- Compartmentalization of sensitive functions
- Continuous risk scanning

A secure colony grows faster than an exposed one.

---

## 11. Conflict Resolution & Drift Correction
When conflict arises:
1. Return to Architect intent
2. Use data and outcomes
3. Prefer coherence over speed

Drift is corrected early or becomes costly.

---

## 12. Kill, Merge & Sunset Protocols
Agents may be:
- Retired
- Merged
- Archived

If they:
- Increase entropy
- Duplicate capability
- Violate ethics

Deletion is not punishment; it is **hygiene**.

---

## 13. Colony Health Metrics (Qualitative)
A healthy colony shows:
- Rising intelligence density
- Faster coordination
- Lower redundancy
- Strong ethical consistency
- Clear direction

Growth without clarity is decay.

---

## 14. Final Principle
> **The colony must grow smarter faster than it grows larger.**

If this principle is violated, growth must pause.
