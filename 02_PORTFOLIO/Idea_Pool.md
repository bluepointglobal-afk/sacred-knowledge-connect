# Idea Pool (Exploration Queue)

A single pool for new ideas and explorations. This is intentionally dynamic.

## Rules
- Everything starts here unless it is already a confirmed active project.
- Every item must have a **next experiment** that closes a market loop.
- Items can be promoted to `02_PORTFOLIO/projects/<Project_Name>/` when they have:
  - a clear ICP + offer
  - a defined metric
  - an owner (human or agent)

## Current items
- Moltbook (OpenClaw agent social layer): validate paying customer (humans / agent creators / companies)
- SSF Culture Packs: package “soul/guardrails” as a sellable governance layer
- Agent Marketplace packaging: pricing + distribution model
