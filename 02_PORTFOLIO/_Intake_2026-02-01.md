## Classification
- **SSF core:** `ssf_v11`, `ssf_real`
- **Faith platform:** `Sacredchain`

## Risks
- Some repos include `.env` / `.env.local` and `node_modules/`. Treat as local-only; ensure secrets are not committed upstream.

## Next Actions
1. ~~Rapid read of each repo's SCOPE/ARCHITECTURE/ROADMAP/STATUS~~ → Done for AFAQ, SacredChain, NoorStudio
2. AFAQ: enforce market loop → Full Sustainability Report pilot ← IN PROGRESS
3. Mawashi: determine whether working tree is missing ← PENDING
