# AFAQ — Sustainability Report Spec v0 (Consulting-grade)

## Goal
Generate a **consulting-style Sustainability Report** that reaches **80–90%** of Big-4/boutique quality at a fraction of cost/time.

Primary outputs:
- **PDF** (print-ready, branded)
- **Web view** (responsive)
- **Data annex** (JSON/CSV exports)

## Design / “taste” requirements
- Strong cover + typography system (headings, pull quotes, callouts)
- Consistent color palette & iconography
- Executive-level charts that match the narrative
- Tables that look like consulting deliverables (spacing, footnotes, numbering)
- “Board-ready” tone: concise, confident, not AI-ish

## Report Structure (baseline)
### Front matter
1. Cover
2. CEO/CFO message (short, editable)
3. About the company (legal name, jurisdiction, reporting period)
4. Report scope & boundaries (entities/sites, value chain)
5. Methodology + standards alignment (what frameworks used and why)
6. Assurance statement placeholder (if none: “not assured”)

### Core narrative
7. Executive summary (key wins, key gaps, priority roadmap)
8. Materiality & stakeholder engagement
   - Approach
   - Stakeholder groups
   - Materiality matrix (placeholder if data limited)
9. Governance
   - governance structure, policies, board oversight
   - anti-corruption, ethics, compliance
10. Strategy
   - sustainability strategy pillars
   - objectives, initiatives, resource allocation
11. Risk management
   - ESG risks/opportunities
   - controls, mitigations
12. Performance: Environmental
   - energy, emissions (Scopes 1/2, Scope 3 optional)
   - water, waste, biodiversity (industry-dependent)
13. Performance: Social
   - workforce, H&S, training
   - community investment
14. Performance: Governance (operational)
   - audits, controls, data governance, privacy/cyber

### Metrics, disclosures, annexes
15. KPI tables (by pillar) + year placeholders
16. Jurisdiction-specific disclosure tables (UAE/KSA/Qatar)
17. Framework indexes (as applicable)
   - GRI Content Index (if chosen)
   - ISSB/IFRS S1/S2 mapping (if chosen)
   - TCFD mapping (if chosen)
18. Data limitations & forward-looking statements
19. Appendices
   - Glossary
   - Definitions & calculation methodologies
   - Evidence register (optional)

## Framework logic (rule-driven)
Inputs:
- Jurisdiction (UAE/KSA/Qatar)
- Listing status (listed/non-listed)
- Industry/sector
- Company size band

Outputs:
- Which disclosure tables appear
- Which KPIs are required vs optional
- Which narrative sections require stronger language vs placeholders

## Automation strategy (80/20)
1) **Deterministic skeleton**: all headings/structure generated by rules (no model).
2) **Data layer**: metrics + questionnaire + evidence map into typed schema.
3) **Narrative layer**: model generates only bounded sections with strict style + word limits.
4) **Design layer**: prebuilt layout components (cover, charts, tables) with theme tokens.
5) **Assembly layer**: render to HTML → PDF (keep fonts + pagination stable).

## Data model (high level)
- CompanyProfile
- ReportingPeriod
- Boundary/Scope
- MaterialTopics
- Policies & Controls
- KPISet (metric definitions + values + sources)
- DisclosureTables (jurisdiction-specific)
- NarrativeBlocks (EN/AR, citations placeholders)
- Limitations & Assumptions

## Quality gates
- No hallucinated legal citations (placeholders only unless verified pack exists)
- Narrative must reference actual KPIs available; otherwise explicit limitation
- Bilingual parity (EN/AR sections align)
- PDF layout QA: headings, TOC, page breaks, tables not cut

## What we need to replicate “Big 4 feel”
- A consistent **story arc** (context → commitments → performance → roadmap)
- **Professional microcopy** (labels, footnotes, definitions)
- **Visual rhythm** (section openers, alternating layouts)
- **Index/mapping** sections (makes it “real” to auditors and stakeholders)

## Next step
Collect 3–5 exemplar PDFs (Big 4 + boutique) and extract:
- Table of contents patterns
- Visual components library
- Common KPI tables and annexes
Then we map them to a reusable component set.
