## Pain Points Section

### The Problem
**You're losing business because you can't prove ESG compliance.**

- Procurement RFPs now demand ESG policies and metrics
- Banks require ESG risk data before lending decisions
- Large clients want supplier sustainability scores
- You don't have an ESG team or AED 150k for consultants

### The Reality
70% of GCC procurement decisions now include ESG criteria. Companies without documentation get filtered out before the evaluation even starts.
