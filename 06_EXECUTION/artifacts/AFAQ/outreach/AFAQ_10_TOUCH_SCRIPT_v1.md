## Touch 1: Cold Email (Procurement Trigger)

**Subject**: Lost a bid over ESG documentation?

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you lost a procurement bid recently because you couldn't provide ESG documentation?

70% of GCC procurement decisions now include ESG criteria. Without the right documentation, you don't even make it to the evaluation stage.

We built AFAQ to solve this for SMEs like [Company Name]. In 72 hours, we deliver:
- Procurement-ready questionnaire responses
- Framework-mapped disclosures (IFRS/TCFD/GRI/UAE SCA)
- Evidence register with explicit limitations
- Professional PDF for boards and clients

No fabricated data. No 6-month consulting project.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits?

## Touch 3: Email Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject**: Re: Lost a bid over ESG documentation?

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Just following up. I know ESG compliance isn't exciting, but losing bids over it is worse.

If you're getting ESG questions from:
- Procurement teams
- Banks
- Large clients

...and you don't have a consultant budget, AFAQ might be exactly what you need.

10 pages. 72 hours. AED 1,499. Done.

Happy to send a sample report if that helps.

## Touch 5: Email with Sample (Day 7)

**Subject**: Sample AFAQ ESG Pack for [Industry]

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Attaching a sample AFAQ pack (anonymized). This is what we deliver in 72 hours:

1. Questionnaire responses (procurement-ready)
2. Evidence register (audit-friendly)
3. Framework mapping (IFRS/TCFD/GRI/UAE)
4. 30/60/90 action plan

The company in this sample went from "ESG-blocked" to winning a major supplier contract.

If this looks useful for [Company Name], let's talk.

## Touch 6: Phone Call Attempt (Day 10)

**Script**:
"Hi [Name], this is [Your name] from AFAQ. I sent you an email about ESG documentation for procurement bids. I know you're busy – just wanted to check if you've had any procurement or bank ESG requests recently? ... [listen] ... We help SMEs get documentation in 72 hours without consultants. Could we schedule 15 minutes this week?"

**If voicemail**:
"Hi [Name], [Your name] from AFAQ. I emailed about ESG documentation for procurement. If you've been losing bids over ESG questions or getting bank requests, we can help in 72 hours. Give me a call back at [number] or reply to my email. Thanks."

## Touch 7: Email (Bank Angle) (Day 14)

**Subject**: CBUAE ESG requirements are hitting SMEs

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

UAE banks are now required to assess ESG risk in their loan books. That means they're sending questionnaires to borrowers – including SMEs.

If [Company Name] has a line of credit or financing relationship with a UAE bank, you'll likely see ESG questions soon (if you haven't already).

AFAQ helps you prepare a documentation pack that:
- Answers the most common bank ESG questions
- Maps to CBUAE ESG framework requirements
- Documents limitations honestly (banks prefer this to silence)

72 hours. Evidence-based. No fabrication.

Want me to show you what banks typically ask?

[Your name]

## Touch 8: LinkedIn Engagement (Day 17)

**Action**: Like + comment on target's post OR share an ESG-related article and tag them

**Comment example**:
"Important point, [Name]. We're seeing more UAE SMEs hit by procurement ESG requirements. The challenge isn't awareness – it's getting the documentation together fast enough to win bids."

---

## Touch 9: Email (Scarcity/Urgency) (Day 21)

**Subject**: [Company Name] + ESG compliance (closing the loop)

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

Last email on this.

If ESG documentation isn't a priority right now, totally understand. But if you're:
- Bidding on contracts with ESG requirements
- Getting bank or investor ESG questions
- Being audited by large clients

...and you need documentation fast, we can help in 72 hours.

Sample attached again in case it's useful. No obligation.

## Touch 10: Breakup Email (Day 28)

**Subject**: Should I close your file?

**Body**:
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about ESG documentation for [Company Name]. I'm guessing it's either:

A) Not a priority right now
B) You already have this covered
C) My emails went to spam

If (A), totally fine – I'll check back in 6 months.
If (B), great – ignore me.
If (C), let me know and I'll send the sample one more time.

Either way, no hard feelings. I'll close this loop unless I hear back.

Cheers,
[Your name]

## Objection Handling

### "We don't have budget for ESG"
"Understood. That's exactly why we built this. Traditional ESG consulting is AED 100-150k. AFAQ is AED 1,499 for a complete pack. Is that still outside budget?"

### "We're not required to do ESG"
"You're right – there's no direct SME ESG law. But procurement teams and banks are asking anyway. Have you seen any ESG questions in recent bids or loan applications?"

### "We have an internal team working on this"
"Great! How long have they been working on it? If they're still in progress, AFAQ can give you a quick baseline in 72 hours while they build the long-term program."

### "I need to check with our CFO/CEO"
"Of course. Would it help if I sent a sample pack they could review? Or would a quick call with both of you work better?"

### "Is this just AI-generated fluff?"
"Fair question. We use AI to map your data to frameworks, but every claim is grounded in evidence you provide. We explicitly document limitations. Nothing fabricated. Want to see a sample?"
