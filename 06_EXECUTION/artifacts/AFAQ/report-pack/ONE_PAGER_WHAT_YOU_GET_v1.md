# AFAQ ESG — Paid Report (What You Get)

## The deliverable
A board/client-ready **Sustainability / ESG Report** (typically 40–60 pages) tailored to your company, jurisdiction, and client questionnaire needs.

### Included
- Executive summary + readiness score + priority gaps
- Governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets sections
- Framework mapping (IFRS S1/S2, TCFD, GRI — as applicable)
- KPI tables with clear data provenance (no fabricated numbers)
- Limitations + data gaps explicitly documented (audit-friendly)
- 30/60/90-day gap-closure plan
- Appendices: glossary, methodology, evidence register, questionnaire mapping

## Turnaround
- Fast-track: **48–72 hours** for first draft after intake + data receipt
- Standard: **5–10 business days** for iteration, review, and final pack

## Inputs we request (minimal viable)
- Company profile (entity, locations, employees)
- Energy/fuel bills or totals (12 months)
- Fleet/logistics data (if relevant)
- H&S incidents/near misses (if tracked)
- HR stats (headcount, turnover, diversity if available)
- Existing policies (code of conduct, supplier policy, H&S policy)

## What “audit-friendly” means
- We **do not invent** metrics.
- Every number has a source or is marked as missing.
- Claims are grounded in your evidence, or clearly stated as planned.
