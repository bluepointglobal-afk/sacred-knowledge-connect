## Proposal Template A: ESG/Sustainability Jobs

**Use for:** ESG reports, sustainability compliance, carbon footprint, questionnaire responses

```
Hi [Client Name],

I can help with your ESG [report/documentation/compliance needs].

I specialize in creating procurement-ready ESG documentation for SMEs, including:
- Questionnaire response packs (ready for RFPs)
- Evidence registers with explicit limitations
- Framework mapping (IFRS S1/S2, TCFD, GRI)
- Professional PDF reports

My approach is evidence-based — I only report what can be documented, and I explicitly note limitations. No fabricated data.

Turnaround: 72 hours from data collection to delivery.

I've recently completed similar work for UAE and GCC companies facing ESG procurement requirements.

Happy to discuss your specific needs.

Best,
Taoufiq

## Execution Plan

**Phase 1 (Week 1):**
1. Architect logs into Upwork
2. Search for 20 relevant jobs across 5 categories
3. Select 10 best-fit jobs (budget >$100, clear scope, serious client)
4. Submit proposals (copy-paste from templates above, customize [bracketed] sections)
5. Track in log: Job URL, proposal sent, budget, client response

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 10 proposals submitted within 48h
- Target: 20-30% response rate (2-3 clients interested)
- Target: 1 job won within 7 days ($100-500 range)

**Tracking:**
Log all submissions in `/Users/architect/.openclaw/workspace/06_EXECUTION/artifacts/AgentMarketplace/PHASE1_SUBMISSIONS_LOG.md`

Format:
```
| Date | Job Title | Job URL | Budget | Proposal | Status | Response |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| 2026-02-04 | ESG Report for UAE SME | upwork.com/jobs/xxx | $300 | Template A | Sent | Pending |
```

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Architect reviews proposals (edit if needed)
2. Add portfolio links/samples to profile
3. Submit 10 proposals manually on Upwork
4. Wait 24-48h for responses
5. Update log with client replies

**If 0 responses after 48h:**
- Revise proposals (shorter, more specific)
- Lower rate by 20%
- Target lower-budget jobs ($50-200)
- Increase volume to 20 proposals

**If 1+ responses:**
- Schedule calls immediately
- Over-deliver on first job (build reputation)
- Request review + testimonial
- Use for future proposals

## Ready for Execution

All proposals drafted. Waiting for Architect to:
1. Review/edit templates
