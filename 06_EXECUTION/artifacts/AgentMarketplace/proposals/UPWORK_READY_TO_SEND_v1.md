## Search 1: ESG Jobs

**Keywords:** `ESG report` OR `sustainability report` OR `ESG compliance` OR `carbon footprint`

### Proposal A: ESG Documentation

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client Name],

I can help with your ESG [report/documentation/compliance needs].

I specialize in creating procurement-ready ESG documentation for SMEs, including:
- Questionnaire response packs (ready for RFPs)
- Evidence registers with explicit limitations
- Framework mapping (IFRS S1/S2, TCFD, GRI)
- Professional PDF reports

My approach is evidence-based — I only report what can be documented, and I explicitly note limitations. No fabricated data.

Turnaround: 72 hours from data collection to delivery.

I've attached a sample pack so you can see exactly what you'd receive.

Happy to discuss your specific requirements.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Search 2: AI Automation Jobs

**Keywords:** `AI automation` OR `Claude integration` OR `GPT workflow` OR `LLM automation`

### Proposal B: AI Workflow Automation

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client Name],

I read your project — sounds like a good fit for [Claude/GPT/AI] automation.

Here's my proposed approach:

**Phase 1 (Day 1-2):** [Understand the workflow, define inputs/outputs]
**Phase 2 (Day 3-5):** [Build the automation pipeline]
**Phase 3 (Day 6-7):** [Test, iterate, deploy]

Tech I'd use:
- LLM: [Claude/GPT-4 — whichever fits your budget]
- Integration: [API/Zapier/Make/custom Python]
- Storage: [Supabase/Airtable/your existing stack]

I recently built [similar project — e.g., "a document processing pipeline that extracts data from PDFs into a database with 95% accuracy"].

Quick questions before I can give a fixed quote:
1. What's your current volume (documents/requests per day)?
2. Do you have an existing tech stack I should integrate with?

Happy to jump on a quick call to scope this properly.

## Search 3: React/Supabase Development

**Keywords:** `React TypeScript` OR `Supabase` OR `Next.js MVP` OR `SaaS MVP`

### Proposal C: Full Stack Development

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client Name],

I can build [your project] with React + TypeScript + Supabase.

Why this stack works for you:
- **Fast auth:** Supabase handles login/signup out of the box
- **Real-time:** Native support if you need live updates
- **Scalable:** Postgres underneath, row-level security built in
- **Payments:** Stripe integration is straightforward

Recent relevant projects:
- ESG compliance platform (React + Supabase + Stripe)
- Islamic education marketplace (teacher booking + payments)
- Document generation system with PDF export

Before quoting, a few questions:
1. Do you have designs/wireframes, or should I handle UI too?
2. What's your timeline expectation?
3. Any specific integrations needed (payment, email, etc.)?

Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.

## Search 4: Technical Writing

**Keywords:** `API documentation` OR `technical writer SaaS` OR `developer documentation`

### Proposal D: Technical Documentation

**Cover Letter:**

Hi [Client Name],

I write technical documentation that developers actually read.

For your [API/product/platform], I can create:
- API reference docs (endpoints, parameters, responses)
- Getting started guides (quick wins first)
- Integration tutorials (step-by-step with working code)
- README improvements

My approach:
1. Start with user goals, not feature lists
2. Include code examples that actually work
3. Test every instruction before publishing
4. Clear structure with quick wins upfront

I've written docs for [AI products, SaaS platforms, developer tools].

Happy to start with a small section as a trial.
