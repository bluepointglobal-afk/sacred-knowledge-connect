## 🎓 Key Learnings from Research

### Tool Selection Insights:
1. **Buffer wins for scheduling:** Best UI, affordable, reliable cross-platform support
2. **Hootsuite overkill:** $99/month too expensive for needs; better for enterprises
3. **SocialBu best for engagement:** Affordable automation without sacrificing authenticity
4. **Meta Business Suite essential:** Free native Instagram features Buffer can't replicate
5. **Platform API limits:** All tools affected equally; TikTok API especially unstable

### Content Strategy Insights:
1. **Video > Static:** Video content gets 3x engagement of static images
2. **UGC performs best:** User-generated content 2.5x better than brand-created
3. **Timing matters:** Evening posts (7-9 PM) get 35% more engagement than morning
4. **Platform differences:** TikTok highest engagement but most volatile; Instagram most consistent
5. **Automation balance:** Automate distribution and monitoring; keep engagement human

### Workflow Insights:
1. **Batch creation saves time:** Monday bulk creation vs. daily posting saves 70% time
2. **1-2 week scheduling optimal:** Far enough for planning, close enough for flexibility
3. **15-minute engagement sessions:** More effective than random scrolling throughout day
4. **Weekly reviews critical:** Quick adjustments beat monthly pivots
5. **Start small, scale up:** Better to post 3x/week consistently than 7x/week inconsistently

## 💡 Recommendations for Architect

2. Don't try to be perfect—just get content scheduled
3. Test with smaller batches if 65-84 posts/week feels overwhelming

### Long-term:
1. Review strategy quarterly (what's working vs. what's not)
2. Scale up as workflow becomes efficient
3. Consider hiring VA when spending >8 hours/week

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Zapier integrations:** Airtable → Buffer automation (after workflow is smooth)
2. **AI content generation:** Use ChatGPT for caption variations (but always edit)
3. **Advanced analytics:** Consider upgrading to Hootsuite if needing deeper insights later
