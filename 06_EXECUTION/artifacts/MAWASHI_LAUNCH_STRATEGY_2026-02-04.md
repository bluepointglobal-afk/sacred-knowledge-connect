## VIRAL MECHANICS — KEY INSIGHT

### Why Mawashi Will Go Viral

**Traditional livestock trading pain points:**
- Farmer A: Spends 3 hours calling buyers
- Buyer B: Calls 10 farmers to find livestock
- Middle-man C: Extracts 20-30% cut by connecting both

**Mawashi solution:**
- Farmer A: Posts livestock → 10 buyers contact in 5 minutes ✅
- Buyer B: Searches listings → finds 50 options instantly ✅
- Middle-man C: Irrelevant (direct connection) ✅

**Viral trigger:** First farmer who saves $500 tells his community → community spreads.

**Speed:** Livestock traders are highly networked (WhatsApp groups, local markets). Word-of-mouth will outpace any marketing.

## BARRIERS TO OVERCOME

| Barrier | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Trust** (farmers won't use it) | Seed with trusted community members, case studies |
| **Offline culture** (prefer in-person) | Show time savings (15 min vs 3 hours) |
| **Payment safety** | Build escrow, guarantee system, insurance partnership |
| **Rural internet** | Mobile-first design, low data usage, SMS fallback |
| **Language** | Arabic-first platform, Arabic support |
| **Competition from middlemen** | They'll resist; overcome with scale (traders prefer direct) |
