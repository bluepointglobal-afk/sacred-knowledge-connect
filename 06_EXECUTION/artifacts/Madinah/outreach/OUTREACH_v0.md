# Madinah Program — Outreach Strategy v0

## Target
Schools and orgs with scale (100+ students) in:
- USA, Canada, UK, Australia, Europe

## Primary angle (institutional)
"Turnkey 30–45 day Madinah immersion for ages 12–17: Arabic foundations + Islamic studies + daily circles at Al‑Masjid an‑Nabawi. We handle accommodation, transport, catering, and logistics end‑to‑end."

## Channel mix
1) **Warm intros** (fastest): imams, principals, board members, youth directors
2) **Email to principals/directors** + follow-up
3) **LinkedIn** (school directors, org leadership)
4) **Conference lists**: Islamic school conferences / ISNA / ICNA / regional orgs

## Outreach sequence (email)
- Day 0: partner invitation + one-pager + ask for student count + dates
- Day 2: case for impact + safety/operations model
- Day 5: scarcity + cohort date hold

## Qualification questions (quick)
1) Students aged 12–17 count? (target 100+ per cohort or across network)
2) Preferred format: 30–45 days vs 15×2?
3) Chaperone policy: school provides vs program provides?
4) Visa constraints: passports/nationalities? (we can facilitate)
