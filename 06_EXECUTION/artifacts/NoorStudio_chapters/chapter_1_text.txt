Chapter 1: The Journey

Amira woke up early that morning, the sun just beginning to peek through her window. "Bismillah," she whispered, as Mama had taught her, before placing her feet on the cool floor.

"Today is the day!" she exclaimed, jumping up with excitement. Today she would visit Grandmother, who lived in the village beyond the hills.

Mama had prepared a basket of treats - fresh dates, honey cakes, and sweet oranges. "Remember, my dear," Mama said, kneeling down to look into Amira's eyes, "the Prophet, peace be upon him, taught us that the best of people are those who are most beneficial to others."

Amira nodded solemnly, clutching the basket. She didn't quite understand what Mama meant, but she would remember those words.

As she walked down the dusty road, the morning breeze carried the scent of jasmine. Birds sang their morning songs, and Amira felt her heart fill with joy. What adventures awaited her today?
