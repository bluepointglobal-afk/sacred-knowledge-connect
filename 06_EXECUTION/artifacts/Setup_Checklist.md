## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Buffer not posting to TikTok automatically**

**Issue: Instagram posts not showing in Meta Business Suite**
- Solution: Ensure Instagram account is Business/Creator account and linked to Facebook Page

**Issue: SocialBu auto-responses not working**
- Solution: Check keyword triggers; may need to adjust phrasing or add variations

**Issue: Running out of content ideas**
- Solution: Review content pillars (strategy doc Section 3); repurpose top performers; engage with audience to see what they want

**Issue: Engagement dropping**
- Solution: Check posting times; increase video content; engage more manually with audience; review analytics for trends

**Issue: Spending too much time on social media**
- Solution: Set timers; batch content creation; use SocialBu more heavily; consider hiring VA for engagement
