# AFAQ — Market Anchor v1 (WIP)

**Status:** Draft v1 — expand to verified competitor map + pricing signals + buyer triggers.

## 0) Gate
We decide what to build only after anchoring on what already wins.

---

## 1) What exists (verified winners / substitutes)

### Enterprise platforms (data + disclosures + reporting)
- Nasdaq Metrio — https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/sustainability/metrio
  - Claims: sustainability data management; framework & disclosure management; carbon accounting; CSR/sustainability communications (reports + microsites)
  - Notes: category leader; competing head-on is expensive.

### Platform-style alternatives (software-first)
- IBM Envizi ESG Suite — (platform) (via sources list)
  - Notes: typically mid-market/enterprise motion; may offer smaller tiers but implementation-heavy.
- Workiva — (platform) (via sources list)
  - Notes: integrated financial + ESG reporting; skew listed/pre-IPO.
- AuditBoard — (platform) (via sources list)
  - Notes: more GRC-oriented; sometimes used for ESG workflows.
- GetApp / G2 / Crozdesk “Metrio alternatives” directories (for list expansion)
  - GetApp: https://www.getapp.ca/alternatives/2047125/metrio
  - G2: https://www.g2.com/products/nasdaq-metrio/competitors/alternatives
  - Crozdesk: https://crozdesk.com/software/nasdaq-metrio

### GCC / MENA focused (platforms + consultancies)
- Sustainium — https://sustainium.ae
  - Positioning: GCC-focused ESG data mgmt + carbon accounting + compliance.
  - Geo: UAE/Oman/Qatar/KSA.
  - Pricing signal: “book demo / talk to sales” → implementation-led mid-market.
- Credible ESG — https://www.crediblesg.com/esg-reporting-platform-for-middle-east/
  - Positioning: ESG reporting platform for Middle East companies; meet regional regulations.
  - Pricing signal: “request demo” (no public price) → quote-based tiers.
- AESG — https://aesg.com/environment-sustainability/carbon-accounting-and-reporting/
  - Type: done-for-you services (carbon accounting & reporting), GHG Protocol-aligned.
  - Pricing signal: project-based.

### SME-friendly / AI-native tools (global)
- Coral — https://www.coral.li
  - Positioning: AI-native ESG + emissions management; “effortless compliance” marketing.
  - Pricing signal: no public price; likely per-entity + data volume; SME tiers plausibly low hundreds USD/month (needs verification).
- Taxilla ESG & Carbon Accounting — https://www.taxilla.com/esg-reporting-software
  - Positioning: ESG reporting + carbon accounting with automated Scope 1–3 tracking + supply-chain visibility.
  - Pricing signal: quote-based; implementation-heavy.

### Pricing benchmarks (useful anchors)
- EcoHedge pricing bands — https://www.ecohedge.com/blog/how-much-does-carbon-accounting-cost-for-smes/
  - Basic: ~£9–£35/mo (Scope 1–2)
  - Intermediate: ~£35–£99/mo
  - Advanced: £99+/mo
  - EcoHedge Express: ~£999/year starting
- Middle East carbon accounting software implementation range (benchmark) — https://www.kenresearch.com/middle-east-carbon-accounting-software-market
  - Signal: ~USD 15k–120k+ depending on complexity/scope (treat as directional benchmark).

### Candidates to verify (still)
- Carbon accounting: Persefoni, Watershed, Sweep, Normative, Plan A, Sinai, Greenly
- SME platforms list source: https://www.keyesg.com/article/best-carbon-accounting-software-platforms

## 2) Buyer + triggers (hypotheses to validate)
- Buyers: CFO/Finance, HSE/Sustainability lead, Procurement/Bid team, CEO (SMEs)
- Triggers: procurement questionnaire, RFP/tender, financing/insurance due diligence, regulator deadlines

---

## 3) What buyers pay for (to verify)
- Platform WTP: audit trail + collaboration + multi-framework reporting + automation
- Concierge WTP: speed + credibility + reduced internal bandwidth cost

---

## 4) Wheel check (don’t rebuild blindly)
- Full Metrio-class platform parity
- Full carbon accounting engine unless we have a narrow wedge

---

## 5) Wedge hypotheses (to validate)
- Procurement Pack: questionnaire → evidence register → board/client-ready PDF fast
- Tender Pack: RFP-ready ESG sections + evidence trail
- GCC bilingual + local regulator mapping

---

## 6) Next experiments
1) Expand competitor map to 15–25 verified entries.
2) Extract pricing/WTP signals.
3) Identify 3–5 exploitable gaps.
4) Write `AFAQ_WEDGE_DECISION_v1.md`.
