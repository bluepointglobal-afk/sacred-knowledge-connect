# AFAQ — Wedge Decision v1 (LAND-only) — 2026-02-02

## 0) Context
ICP: **SME founder/CEO or manager** in UAE/KSA/Qatar with no ESG team, facing a short-window **maturity gap** (procurement + banks + indirect regulation).

We are not building an enterprise ESG platform today. We are winning the maturity gap with a **fast, credible, audit-friendly pack**.

## 1) Verified “why now” triggers (GCC SMEs)
### Procurement / large buyers
- Supplier onboarding and RFPs increasingly demand ESG proof (policies, carbon data, governance, evidence), not promises.

### Banks / finance
- UAE banking ESG risk integration pushes downstream requests for borrower ESG data/policies.

### Indirect regulation pressure
- Listed-company ESG rules cascade into supplier requests.

## 2) Competitor reality (what we will not do)
- **Metrio-class platforms** (Nasdaq Metrio) solve enterprise-wide workflows: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/sustainability/metrio
- GCC platforms exist (Sustainium, Credible ESG) and consultancies exist (AESG).
- Middle East implementations can be expensive and slow (benchmark): https://www.kenresearch.com/middle-east-carbon-accounting-software-market

## 3) Wedge (decision)
**Wedge:** “72h Compliance/Disclosure Pack for GCC SMEs”

### One-sentence positioning
**Get procurement/bank-ready ESG disclosures in 72 hours with an audit-friendly evidence register and zero fabricated numbers.**

## 4) What we sell (LAND offer)
**AFAQ 72h Pack** (choose jurisdiction: UAE / KSA / Qatar; language: EN/AR)
1) **Questionnaire Response Pack** (procurement-ready)
2) **Evidence Register + Limitations** (audit-friendly)
3) **Framework Mapping** (IFRS S1/S2 + TCFD + GRI as applicable)
4) **Board/Client A4 PDF** (derived from 1–3, clearly grounded)

## 5) What we build vs integrate (MVP scope)
### Build now
- Structured intake → disclosure pack assembler (data schema + evidence register + mapping)
- Report generator (HTML → A4 PDF) *as output formatting*, not a platform
- Logging + runbooks (repeatable execution)

### Integrate / reuse
- For deep carbon accounting: partner/tool (don’t rebuild engine)
- For enterprise workflow: we explicitly position away from that

## 6) Acceptance test (the only thing that matters)
We win when an SME CEO/manager says:
- “Send me the pack / invoice” after seeing the sample
- AND we can deliver within 72 hours with a clean evidence trail

## 7) Market-to-market loop (shrink time)
**Goal:** first validation signal in 48–72h.
1) Market anchor (done in progress)
2) Cook: single landing + sample pack + pricing anchors
3) Back to market: 10 touches (procurement-triggered prospects)
4) Decision: double / iterate / kill

## 8) Immediate next actions
- Expand competitor list to 15–25 verified entries from G2/GetApp/Crozdesk directories.
- Write the 10-touch outreach script (procurement + bank triggers).
- Produce one premium sample “Questionnaire Response Pack” (10–15 pages) + evidence register.
