# Market Anchor — <PROJECT> (v1)

**Gate:** Before building beyond stubs, we produce this.

## 1) What exists (verified winners)
List 10–25 competitors / substitutes. For each:
- Name + URL
- Category (platform / service / marketplace / tool)
- Core value proposition (verbatim if possible)
- Target buyer + segment
- Pricing signal (if public)
- Why they win

## 2) Buyer + triggers (why now)
- Buyer roles
- Urgency triggers
- Procurement path (self-serve vs sales-led)

## 3) What buyers pay for (WTP)
- Packages that sell
- Price bands
- Proof buyers demand

## 4) Wheel check (reuse vs build)
- What we should integrate / copy
- What not to rebuild

## 5) Wedge hypotheses
- Geo / niche / audience / distribution / feature wedge

## 6) Decision memo (1 page)
- Category choice (platform/concierge/hybrid)
- MVP scope (build vs integrate)
- 1-sentence positioning
- Acceptance test: “a buyer pays when …”

## 7) Next experiments (market loop)
Hypothesis → Offer → Artifact → Distribution → Instrumentation → Learning → Decision
