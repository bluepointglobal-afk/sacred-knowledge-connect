# NoorStudio — Market Anchor v1 (WIP)

## 0) Gate
NoorStudio must be anchored to what already wins in:
- children’s book generation
- illustration + cover design workflows
- publishing/export pipelines

## 1) What exists (to verify)
- Book gen tools (AI): (to research)
- Illustration tools: Midjourney/SD-based apps, Canva, Adobe Express
- Self-publishing platforms: KDP, IngramSpark

## 2) Buyer + triggers
- Parents, educators, creators
- Trigger: want a polished book artifact fast

## 3) WTP
- Pay per book / subscription

## 4) Wheel check
- Don’t rebuild illustration stacks; integrate the best
- Win on workflow, templates, export, and consistency

## 5) Wedge hypotheses
- Arabic/Islamic content specialization
- “Print-ready in one click”

## Next
- Verify top players and reverse-engineer the winning workflow.
