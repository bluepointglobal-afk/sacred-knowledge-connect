# SacredChain — Market Anchor v1 (WIP)

## 0) Gate
SacredChain decisions must be anchored to existing winners in:
- tutoring/lesson marketplaces
- session booking + payments/escrow
- creator/teacher monetization

## 1) What exists (to verify)
- General tutoring: Wyzant, Preply, italki
- Marketplace infra: Stripe Connect (marketplace payments), Calendly-style scheduling
- Islamic learning platforms: (to research)

## 2) Buyer + triggers
- Students: finding credible teachers quickly
- Teachers: monetization + lead gen + trust signals
- Orgs: training / cohort learning

## 3) WTP
- Student pays per session/bundle
- Teacher pays subscription or revshare

## 4) Wheel check
- Use Stripe Connect patterns; don’t invent payments/escrow semantics
- Use proven booking UX patterns

## 5) Wedge hypotheses
- Trust + verification + Islamic scholarship credibility
- Geo/timezone localization

## Next
- Build verified competitor map + differentiators; then lock positioning.
