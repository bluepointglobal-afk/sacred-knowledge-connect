# AFAQ ESG — Market Loop Plan v0

## ICP (initial)
Small companies in UAE/KSA/Qatar that must comply but lack internal ESG expertise/staff.
- Buyer roles: CEO / CFO / HSE staff

## Offer (two-stage)
1) **Free/Freemium:** Compliance score + gap analysis (fast)
2) **Paid (chosen):** **Full Sustainability Report** (includes disclosure) aligned to applicable framework(s) by industry + jurisdiction

## Fastest feedback loop (7 days)
### Hypothesis
"If we offer a rapid compliance score + gap plan for SMEs in GCC, decision-makers will book calls and pay for disclosure/report generation because they lack knowledge and bandwidth."

### Artifact to test
- One landing page + booking flow + 1-page sample output
- Concierge delivery for first cohort (manual + templates), while product catches up

### Distribution
- Email outreach + targeted ads

### Metrics
- Landing → booking conversion
- Reply rate
- Calls booked/week
- Paid pilot conversions
- Time-to-value (score + gaps)

### Decision gates
- After 20 outreach touches: do we get replies?
- After 10 calls: do we see repeatable pain + willingness to pay?
- After 3 paid pilots: do we see retention/expansion signals?
