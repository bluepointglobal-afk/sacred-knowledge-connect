- **Tracking:** Interest forms, parent information sessions, preliminary registrations

#### Metric 5: Financial Feasibility

### Success Indicators (Qualitative)
✅ School leaders respond positively and ask substantive questions  
✅ Parents express excitement and share with other families  
✅ Students engage authentically during info sessions  
✅ Schools offer to promote program to their community  
✅ Minimal pushback on pricing (indicates value perception)  
✅ Schools request customization or group booking (high engagement)

### Red Flags (What Would Invalidate the Concept?)
🚩 <30% response rate after 3 weeks  
🚩 Schools interested but <10 students per school show interest  
🚩 >70% of families cite cost as prohibitive even with aid  
🚩 Safety/liability concerns become a dealbreaker for multiple schools  
🚩 No school willing to partner after 12 weeks of outreach  
🚩 Regulatory/visa issues prove too complex for target age group

### Decision Framework

| Outcome | Next Steps |
|---------|------------|
| **Strong Validation** (≥5 metrics met) | Proceed to full pilot planning; recruit 20-30 students; launch Summer 2026 |
| **Moderate Validation** (3-4 metrics met) | Iterate on messaging/pricing; expand outreach to 20 schools; delay 3 months |
| **Weak Validation** (≤2 metrics met) | Pivot: consider different age group, location, or program format; conduct parent surveys |
| **Invalidated** (red flags triggered) | Pause project; reassess market fit; explore alternative approaches (local programs, virtual, etc.) |

### Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Initial outreach to 10 schools  
**Week 3-4:** Follow-ups + discovery calls  
**Week 5-6:** Send program packets + schedule parent info sessions  
**Week 7-8:** Collect student interest forms + financial assessments  
**Week 9-10:** Partnership negotiations + contract discussions  
**Week 11-12:** Validation review + GO/NO-GO decision

### Reporting & Check-Ins
- **Weekly:** Update tracking spreadsheet (response rates, call bookings)
- **Bi-weekly:** Review metrics against targets; adjust outreach strategy
- **Week 6:** Mid-point validation review (are we on track?)
- **Week 12:** Final validation assessment + decision meeting
