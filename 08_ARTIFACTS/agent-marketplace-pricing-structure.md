## Positioning Against Competitors

| Competitor | Model | Typical Price | OpenClaw Advantage |
|------------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Freelance Developers** | Custom code | $50-150/hr ($20K-60K) | Pre-built framework, faster delivery |
| **Agency Build** | Custom chatbot/automation | $30K-100K | Autonomous execution, not just chat |
| **SaaS Platforms (Zapier, Make)** | Subscription | $50-500/mo | True autonomy, not workflow automation |
| **Enterprise RPA (UiPath, etc.)** | License + implementation | $50K-500K+ | Flexible, AI-native, lower cost |

**OpenClaw sweet spot:** $10K-75K for production-ready autonomous agents (not simple automation, not enterprise RPA overkill)

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Quote fixed price without discovery  
✅ **Do:** Always start with discovery phase or paid scoping

❌ **Don't:** Include ongoing LLM costs in project price  
✅ **Do:** Client uses their API keys or clear pass-through billing

❌ **Don't:** Underprice to win deals  
✅ **Do:** Walk away from low-budget mismatches (refer to lower-tier or decline)

❌ **Don't:** Offer unlimited revisions  
✅ **Do:** Define 2 revision rounds, charge for scope creep
