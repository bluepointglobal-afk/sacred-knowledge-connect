## Red Flags to Avoid
❌ Don't overpromise AGI-level reasoning
❌ Don't commit to timelines without discovery
❌ Don't quote fixed prices for vague scopes
❌ Don't hide ongoing costs (LLM usage, APIs)
❌ Don't skip security/privacy discussion

## Green Lights to Emphasize
✅ Clear, measurable success criteria
✅ Phased delivery with checkpoints
✅ Transparent cost structure
✅ Reference implementations or demos
✅ Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
