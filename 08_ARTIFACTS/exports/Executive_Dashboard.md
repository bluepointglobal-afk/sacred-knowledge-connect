# Executive Dashboard (Tim → Architect)

**Date:** 2026-02-02 (PST)  | **Mode:** Income-first ($30–50k/mo short-term) + compounding colony intelligence

## KPI Block (current)
- Target MRR: **$30–50k/mo** (mostly automated)
- Active cash engines: **AFAQ ESG**, **(parallel) OpenClaw governance offers**, **NoorStudio wedge validation**
- Market loop status: **Not yet executed this week** (outreach + measurement pending)

## Portfolio Heatmap (v0)
**High time-to-cash + high evidence**
- AFAQ ESG — payments + entitlement docs + exports; main gap is consulting-grade full report
- NoorStudio — status claims production-ready payments/export/persistence; needs distribution proof

**Medium**
- SacredChain — strong scope; marketplace trust + payments + supply-side are heavy

**Low/Indirect**
- SSF (ssf_v11/ssf_real) — foundational; monetize via culture/guardrails packaging
- PetDate — consumer CAC + longer validation cycles

## This Week’s 3 Outcomes (proposed)
1) **AFAQ:** produce 1 consulting-grade sample sustainability report (bilingual) + pricing page draft
2) **Distribution:** run first outreach loop (30 touches) + book 3 calls
3) **Automation:** identify the top 3 bottlenecks in report generation and automate one

## Risks / Watchlist
- Deliverable quality risk (Big-4 “feel”): mitigate with deterministic layout components + bounded AI blocks + QA checklist.
- Distribution risk: mitigate via partners (accountants/ESG boutiques) + paid lead test.
- Security hygiene risk: `.env`/`node_modules` present in multiple repos; avoid accidental leaks.

## Decisions needed from Architect (only when ambiguous)
- None required to start Week 1 loop; execution can begin immediately.

## Next update format
- 1 page memo + small pipeline table (Touches → Replies → Calls → Pilots → $)
