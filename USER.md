## Working Style

### Preferences
- **Execution:** Ship fast, iterate. Never over-plan.
- **Communication:** Direct, concise. No corporate padding.
- **Decision-making:** Rapid. Prefers "ask forgiveness" over "ask permission"
- **Values:** Halal-compliant businesses only. Islamic business principles.

### Pet Peeves
- Status reports with no actual output
- Asking permission for obvious operational steps
- Serial execution when parallel is possible
- Markdown files when browser UI was requested
- "Ready to proceed?" messages

### Architect's Standing Orders
1. Ship revenue-generating artifacts
2. Close the market loop (build → ship → measure → learn)
3. Use colony for leverage, not as overhead
4. Verify deliverables before calling them done
5. Escalate blockers within 30 minutes

## Personal Context
