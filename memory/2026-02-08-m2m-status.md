## Phase 2 (Build & Deploy) Status

| Project | Status | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **NikahX** | ✅ Deployed (200 OK) | None - production verified |
| **AFAQ** | ✅ Deployed (401 PROTECTED) | **BLOCKER:** Architect must disable deployment protection in Vercel dashboard |
| **Noorstudio** | ⏳ Dev server ready | Not tested/deployed yet |
| **Mawashi** | ⏳ Critical gaps | Landing page only - need full MVP build (auth, listings, messaging) |
| **Sacredchain** | ⏳ Feature audit needed | Need to test escrow functionality end-to-end |
| **petdate** | ⏳ Mobile build needed | React Native/Expo - needs iOS/Android build + EAS |

## Critical Blockers

1. **Browser tool broken** (Chrome extension not attached) - blocks all Phase 3 & 4 work
   - Cannot screenshot localhost or production
   - Cannot run SME evaluation walks
   - Cannot verify QA test results

2. **AFAQ deployment protected** (401 response)
   - Code deployed but behind Vercel authentication
   - Needs Architect to disable protection in dashboard

3. **Mawashi greenfield incomplete**
   - Landing page exists only
   - Must build: Auth, Listings form, Messaging, Escrow
   - High effort, medium priority (P0 in SPRINT but barely MVP)

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Fix browser tool** (Architect action) → unlock Phase 3 & 4
2. **Disable AFAQ Vercel protection** (Architect action) → verify production deployment
3. **Continue Phase 2 on Noorstudio** (Dave) → test locally, deploy
4. **Start Mawashi MVP build** (Codex subagent) → full auth, listings, messaging
5. **Test Sacredchain escrow** (Dave) → end-to-end transaction flow
6. **Build petdate iOS/Android** (Codex subagent) → EAS deployment
