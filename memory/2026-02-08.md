## 09:30 - [NikahX] M2M Phase 1+2 Complete
- Market research: Muzz/Salams/AlKhattaba analysis (6M+ users each)
- ICP created: Fatima (28, British-Somali, London)
- Feature audit: MuftiAI/Mahr/Firasa = unique differentiators
- Gaps: Screenshot blocker, voice notes, sect filters
- Dev server tested: localhost:5173 ✓
- Deployed: https://nikahplus-4ouwh89dn-bluepoints-projects-444aa9bb.vercel.app
- Production status: 200 OK ✓
- Output: reports/icp-nikahx.md

**BLOCKER:** Browser tool broken (Chrome extension not attached)
- Cannot screenshot localhost
- Cannot screenshot production
- Cannot run Phase 4 SME evaluation
- Blocks verification loop for all projects

**Next:** Create QA script for Phase 3, or move to next M2M project

## 09:51 - [AFAQ] Production Redeployed via Vercel CLI
- `vercel --prod` from AFAQesg repo — build succeeded (12s)
- `afaq-esg-navigator.vercel.app/sample-report` → 200 OK ✅
- `afaq-esg.vercel.app/sample-report` → still 404 ❌ (different Vercel project!)
- The correct production URL is `afaq-esg-navigator.vercel.app`
- TOOLS.md had wrong URL — should be updated
- **BLOCKER RESOLVED:** GitHub→Vercel auto-deploy bypassed via CLI deploy
- **REMAINING:** `afaq-esg.vercel.app` domain points to wrong/old project — Architect may want to alias it
