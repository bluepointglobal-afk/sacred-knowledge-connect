## Problem Statement

**Muslims worldwide lack easy access to qualified scholars for sacred knowledge, while Western businesses struggle to find vetted Islamic experts.**

Current pain points:
- No unified platform connecting learners with renowned scholars globally
- Parents struggle to find trusted Quran/Islamic studies teachers for children
- Non-Muslims interested in Islamic history, arts, calligraphy have no dedicated learning platform
- Western businesses need Islamic consultants (halal certification, legal, education) but lack access
- Scholars have limited reach and no platform to both teach AND consult for businesses

### 2. B2B: Sacredchain for Businesses
