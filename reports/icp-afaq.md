  - Manual data collection across departments
  - Unfamiliar with GRI, IFRS S1/S2 frameworks
  - No in-house sustainability expertise
  - Needs audit-ready reports for compliance

2. **Khalid** (Sustainability Officer, Qatar gas company, Vision 2030 reporting)
3. **Sarah** (Consultant, Jeddah, managing ESG for 5 SME clients)

## Target Markets
1. **Saudi Arabia** - CMA mandates, Saudi Exchange ESG rules, Vision 2030
2. **UAE** - Dubai/Abu Dhabi SMEs with EU trade (CSRD/CBAM)
3. **Qatar/Kuwait/Bahrain** - Growing ESG awareness, Vision alignment

## Competitors (2026)

| Platform | Strength | Framework Support | SME Positioning |

| **IntegrityNext** | Supplier assessments, AI risk | CSRD, EUDR, CBAM, GRI | Supply chain compliance |

**Pricing:** Not public, customized per users/modules/scope. Likely $10K-50K/year for SMEs.

**Market Growth:** ESG software market: USD 1.24B (2025) → USD 5.19B (2033), 20.1% CAGR.

## AFAQ Feature Audit (Brownfield)

### ✅ GOLD (Have + Market Wants)
- **Questionnaire** (framework-aligned data collection)
- **Metric Input** (quantitative data entry)
- **Narrative Input/Intake** (qualitative disclosures)
- **Compliance Results** (gap analysis?)
- **Disclosure** (report generation?)
- **Export Panel** (audit-ready outputs)
- **Sample Report** (demo for prospects)
- **Stripe Payment** (subscription ready)
- **Company Settings** (multi-company support?)

### ⚠️ MISSING (Competitors Have)
- **Automated data integrations** (TSC has IoT, EcoOnline has 200+ integrations)
- **Real-time dashboards** (TSC, EcoOnline have this)
- **Carbon accounting** (Scope 1-3 emissions calculator)
- **Climate risk assessment** (EcoOnline feature)
- **Supplier assessments** (IntegrityNext strength)
- **Training modules** (TSC capacity building)
- **CDP score improvement** (EcoOnline)
- **AI risk analytics** (IntegrityNext)
- **Saudi CMA/Saudi Exchange specific templates** (critical for KSA market)

### ❌ UNCERTAIN (Need Code Audit)
- Does "Compliance Results" show gap analysis?
- Does "Disclosure" generate full reports or just exports?
- Is carbon accounting part of Metric Input?
- Multi-company support for consultants?
- Framework coverage: GRI? IFRS S1/S2? CMA? Saudi Exchange?

### 🚩 UNNECESSARY (Possible Bloat)
- TBD after SME evaluation (Phase 4)

## Sweet Spot

**AFAQ's Potential Edge:**
1. **GCC-First Design** - If built for Saudi CMA/Vision 2030 (vs. generic EU tools adapted later)
2. **SME Price Point** - Undercut TSC/Ecometrica ($5K-10K vs. $10K-50K)
3. **Simplicity** - No overwhelming features for small teams
4. **Sample Report Demo** - Lowers barrier to trial

**Winning Positioning:**
"ESG reporting for Saudi SMEs that's actually built for CMA compliance. Get audit-ready reports in hours, not weeks. No consultants required."

## Market Gaps to Exploit

1. **Saudi-Specific Templates:** Pre-built CMA/Saudi Exchange disclosure templates (critical differentiator)
2. **Hybrid Model:** Light consulting bundled with software (TSC does this)
3. **Arabic Language:** UI + reports in Arabic (none of the competitors emphasize this)
4. **Vision 2030 Storytelling:** Tie ESG to Saudi national goals (emotional hook)

## Phase 2 Recommendation

**Audit First (P0):**
1. What frameworks are currently supported? (Check questionnaire templates)
2. Does it generate full reports or just data exports?
3. Is carbon accounting included?
4. Multi-company support working?

**Build Next (P0):**
1. **Saudi CMA template** (if missing - critical for KSA market)
2. **Carbon calculator** (Scope 1-3 emissions - table stakes)
3. **Real-time dashboard** (visual progress tracking)
4. **Arabic UI** (at least reports, ideally full UI)

**Build After (P1):**
5. IoT/integration layer (automated data collection)
6. Training modules (capacity building for HSE managers)
7. Consultant multi-company mode (manage 5-10 clients)

**Cut/Defer:**
- Supplier assessments (IntegrityNext's niche, not core SME need)
- AI risk analytics (overkill for SMEs, expensive to build)

## Revenue Model Check

- Stripe integrated ✓
- Payment Success/Cancel pages ✓
- Pricing tiers? (Need to check)
- Free trial? (Check onboarding flow)

**Next:** Run Phase 2 locally to audit feature completeness.
