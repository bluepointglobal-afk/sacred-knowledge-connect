## NikahX Feature Audit (Brownfield)

### ✅ GOLD (Have + Market Wants)
- Auth system (login/signup/verification)
- Profile editor & viewing
- Discovery/swiping interface
- Matches + Chat
- **MuftiAI** (Islamic guidance - unique differentiator)
- **Mahr Calculator** (unique - competitors lack this)
- **Firasa** (character assessment - unique)
- **Family Panel** (chaperone/wali involvement)
- Premium/Subscription (Stripe integrated)

### ⚠️ BROKEN/MISSING (Market Expects)
- **Screenshot blocker** (Salams has this, critical for trust)
- **Voice notes** in chat (common in competitors)
- **Blurred photo reveal** (AlKhattaba has this)
- **Sect/madhab filters** (Lumi has this, GCC needs it)
- **Verified profile badges** (unclear if implemented)
- **Profile boost** (competitors monetize this)

### ❌ UNNECESSARY (We Have, Market Doesn't Care)
- (TBD - needs SME evaluation to identify bloat)

## Sweet Spot

**NikahX's Unique Value:**
1. **MuftiAI** - No competitor has AI Islamic guidance
2. **Mahr Calculator** - Solves real friction in Muslim marriages
3. **Firasa** - Character/compatibility assessment (if done well)

**Winning Positioning:**
"The only Islamic matrimonial app with built-in Islamic guidance (MuftiAI) and transparent mahr negotiation. Find your match with confidence and your wali by your side."

## Market Gaps to Exploit

1. **Trust Layer:** Screenshot blocker + verified badges (build immediately)
2. **GCC Expansion:** Sect/madhab filters (Saudi/UAE market)
3. **Family-First:** Enhanced chaperone features (video call support)
4. **AI Edge:** MuftiAI as decision-support (not just chat) - "Should I pursue this match?"

## Phase 2 Recommendation

**Build Next (P0):**
1. Screenshot blocker (critical trust signal)
2. Verified profile badges (reduces fakes)
3. Voice notes in chat (parity with competitors)

**Build After (P1):**
4. Sect/madhab filters (GCC expansion)
5. Profile boost monetization (revenue)
6. Blurred photo reveal (privacy option)

**Cut/Defer:**
- TBD after SME evaluation (Phase 4)
