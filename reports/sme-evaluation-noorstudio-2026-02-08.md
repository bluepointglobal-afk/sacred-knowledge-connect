## VERDICT: WOULD EXPLORE ✅

Sarah would sign up for a free trial. She would NOT pay £50-200/month yet — needs to test character consistency quality first.

## The Walk (As Sarah)

### Landing Page — First Impressions
**Title:** "Noor Studio | Create Islamic Children's Books with Consistent Characters"

**Immediate reaction:** "Oh, this is specifically for Islamic children's books? Very niche. But... AI doing my job? Is it good enough to replace hand-illustrated work?"

**Trust Signals That Work:**
- ✅ Social proof: 12,500+ characters, 3,200+ books, 50,000+ pages — real usage
- ✅ "Three Steps to Published" framework — speaks to my painful workflow (Procreate → InDesign → printer hell)
- ✅ **Consistency comparison section** — THIS IS THE MONEY SHOT. Character consistency across 32 pages is the #1 hardest thing. If this works, it's worth investigating.
- ✅ "Built with Islamic Values in Mind" (Age-Appropriate, Islamic Adab Compliance, Scholar Review) — shows domain expertise, not just tech
- ✅ Story Structure Templates (Middle-Grade Adventure, Junior Values, Educational Dialogue) — they understand the content space
- ✅ 500+ Muslim authors testimonial badge

**Trust Killers / Friction Points:**
- 🚩 **Are those AI images actually consistent?** The comparison slider shows "Before" with inconsistent characters and "After" with consistent ones. Is "After" using Noorstudio? Or is this a fake demo?
- 🚩 **No sample books to download.** I want to see a full 32-page book generated with this tool. PDF download button should be prominent.
- 🚩 **Pricing hidden.** The /pricing link goes to 404. I need to know cost before signing up.
- 🚩 **Who are the "500+ Muslim authors"?** No testimonials, no case studies, no author names/photos. Makes me suspicious.
- 🚩 **"Get started" button — what does that mean?** Free trial? Free forever? Freemium? Clarify the pricing model.

### Pricing Page
**Status:** 404 — broken link.
**Reaction:** "This is a major red flag. If you can't even keep your pricing page live, how stable is the product?"

### Examples Page  
**Status:** 404 — broken link.
**Reaction:** "I specifically want to see examples. This is deal-breaker territory. No examples = no credibility."

## Scoring

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **First Impression** | 4/5 | Clean, professional, niche-focused |
| **Trust** | 2/5 | Numbers look good but no proof. 404 pages kill credibility. |
| **Value Proposition** | 4/5 | Character consistency is a real pain point |
| **Product Demo** | 1/5 | No downloadable sample books. 404 on /examples. |
| **Pricing Clarity** | 0/5 | /pricing page 404 |
| **Would I Sign Up?** | YES | Free trial with low friction |
| **Would I Pay?** | NO | Not until I see real examples and pricing |

**Overall: 2.5/5 — WOULD EXPLORE**
