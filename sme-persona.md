# SME Persona — SacredChain

## Demographics
- **Role:** Head of Compliance, mid-size food manufacturing company expanding into Middle East
- **Company type:** 500-employee food manufacturer (UK-based, expanding to UAE/Saudi markets)
- **Market:** UK → GCC export, Halal certification required for market access
- **Experience level:** 15 years in food compliance (BRC, FDA, organic), first time dealing with Halal

## Context
- **Why they're looking:** Board mandated GCC expansion Q3 2026, Halal cert is hard blocker to enter supermarkets in UAE/Saudi
- **Budget:** £5,000-15,000 for consulting (approved), need it done in 8-10 weeks to hit Q3 launch
- **Time pressure:** High — delayed cert = missed entire 2026 revenue target for Middle East ($2M+ at risk)
- **Current solution:** Called 3 Halal cert bodies, got conflicting info, pricing unclear, 12-week timeline quoted, no consultant to guide prep

## Psychology
- **Trust triggers:** 
  1. Consultant credentials (which cert bodies they've worked with, successful case studies in food manufacturing)
  2. Fixed-price or clear hourly rate (no surprises)
  3. Timeline guarantee (can they actually hit 8 weeks?)
  4. UK/European client references (proves they understand Western business processes)
- **Objections:**
  1. "How do I know this consultant actually knows Halal cert vs just 'Islamic expert'?" (specialization)
  2. "What if we pay and still fail the audit?" (risk)
  3. "Can they guide ingredient substitution without ruining recipes?" (outcome quality)
- **Decision process:** Solo buyer (compliance head), but needs to present consultant + timeline to CFO for budget approval
- **Industry vocabulary:** "Halal certification bodies," "ingredient traceability," "cross-contamination protocols," "Halal audit prep," "HAS 23000," "JAKIM," "GCC Halal standards"

## Success Criteria
- **What "done" looks like:** 
  1. Halal cert awarded by accredited body (HAS/JAKIM/equivalent)
  2. No production line downtime during transition
  3. Zero recipe reformulation failures (product still tastes the same)
  4. Consultant guides full audit prep so we pass first time
- **Willingness to pay:** £200-400/hour for a proven consultant, or £8,000-12,000 fixed-price project
- **Deal breaker:** Consultant has no food manufacturing experience, unclear deliverables, "just pray and you'll pass" vibe (need rigor, not piety)

## Buying Journey
**Trigger:** Board meeting: "We need Halal cert to enter UAE market by Q3."
**Alternative:** Direct engagement with cert body (12 weeks, no guidance, high risk of failed audit), hire Big 4 consulting (£50K+, overkill for this), delay GCC launch to 2027 (revenue loss)
**Decision timeline:** Will book 30-minute discovery call with 2-3 consultants this week. Whoever demonstrates expertise + clear process + 8-week feasibility wins the contract by Friday.
